            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and
                intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes
                Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The
                European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences
                spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other
                civilizations – as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of
                knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's
                Elements for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment
                saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has
                an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a
                person",[6] or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men".[7] This was a broad conceptualization of
                education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by
                community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social
                class and gender.[8] There was also the word neixtlamachiliztli, which is "the act of giving wisdom to
                the face."[7] These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented
                towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for
                the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for
                all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                education than in all of human history thus far.</p>
